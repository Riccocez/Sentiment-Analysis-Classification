"They say they are honest and all the good adjectives but what they dont say is they will increase your tariff after a month and that £7 does not include VAT charges..

"They have the worst customer support. To find a way to get to them takes away all your patience. I am a new customer and trying to redeem a voucher. Also I closed my account with G3 telecom services to sign up with rebtel. I used 2 vouchers and none of them worked. I was without any telecom services for about a day and I had to call my parents in India. They provide expired codes to our company maybe so that people like us would sign up for an account and then bam! That is it, you don't get any credit against that voucher. I had to flip through the FAQs, read help articles and then they thought they had their fun so after 15 minutes of struggle the website gave me chat option. I still wasn't losing faith in them. I talked to an agent and he was rude and absurd. I even told him how important it was for me to make a call to India. He was totally helpless and I don't even think how to treat customers. He didn't even what I was talking about! When I thought he is not helping me out, I rated him 1 star and ended the conversation. He came back to me saying I was rude for giving him 1 star and that he was thinking of giving me some credit. That was unacceptable since I did not want to talk to him and ended the chat, he had no right to reopen the chat and send me messages. Also there is technically no way that you can end a chat except by closing out the website!!! I would suggest them to hire more polite reps and also train them to help us out better.",Worst customer support,1,6,2,2017,13,44,52,1,6,2017-02-06T13:44:52,Canada,Dhairya,1,511,0,

Honestly I never had such a haunting experience with any service provider. I was told about Rebtel by my friend and I googled Rebtel Website. The welcome page says Unlimited Calls to India and Try One week free. I created an account on Nov 8th 2:25 PM hence I was eligible under free trial until Nov 15th. I decided to continue hence a payment of $10 was deducted from my card on 15th November. I made numerous calls from November 8th till yesterday to India but got a shock of my life when T-Mobile Service Provider sent me a hefty bill for all those calls. They told all those calls were made using their Network Towers. I emailed Rebtel Immediately since deliberately there is no customer care number given to call. Another shock I got when a customer care Representative told me that my free trial was expired on same day of activation i.e November 8th and it is reactivated on Nov 15 so now you can make calls. I told about my whole experience and the way he replied was very insensitive and unprofessional.

Some times I call overseas and norespond but already three minutes go on. and some time when you speak they hear you but you can't hear to them I only use it because I don't have time to buy phone card otherwise it's more chiper and clear.

"This company absolutely has no value for you as a customer. It is evident from the fact that they don't even have a customer care number. I have been using their service from few months. I recently found out that they have started charging me twice from last couple of months. Last month, I reached out to them asking why i was charged twice and they said, sorry, it was their system error and they cant refund, instead i can use their service for the amount they charged me. Which means I only wanted 30 days of service and they forced me 60 days service by charging twice. They also said, this won't repeat. I removed my credit card details and added a new credit card so that, they wont use my old credit card to charge twice again. Just found they have again charged me twice on the new credit card.

It made me think my fiancée was quarrelling with me and won't pick up her phone whereas her phone was completely off because she couldn't charge he phone. Also my credit got deducted for those dials about 20min plus because I continued dialing and each dial lasted 2 mins each which really made me mad. well am over it now.

I tried out Rebtel and was pleased with the result. I recommended the company to friends and family. All seems fine until there is a problem. On this occasion I credited my account using the  Paypal option. Rebel did not give me the credit - while I could see from Paypal that they had been paid. I contacted Rebel - they told me that they could not see any error on their part and asked for more details. I sent Rebel my Paypal receipt = no answer. I chased them up = no answer. I went to Paypal and filed a dispute. Rebel immediately suspended my account and sent me an automated message. I replied to Rebel = no answer.,The On-site Customer Service link is poor.

"Hi folks,  please stay away from this company. I am a new rebtel client. Prices per min changing so quick and by huge difference on this platform. For example when I topped up by fiver on the day it showed my balance 200 min to one European country mobiles,  After three days showed only 8 min available. Price sky rocketing per min from 2,5c to 35c. Mad increased in price without any notification. I dont understand how this can happen??  This is  a joke or scam or what??? Also on the day i been offerd subscription unlimited calls for 7$per month to one european country. Now I dont see any subscription available particulary for that country at all. What I noticed  this crowd working so tricky and fools the people. They advertising and promoting product/service for one price, but at the end consumer gets absolutely different price. This matter  should be reported to consumer protection authorities this absolutely ilegal to act in the way they does. They should be sued for breaching consumer rights.

"Please do not use this service. I had used it Rebtel for at least 3 years now, successfully only to wake up to the worst case scenario and an even worse customer service platform. They posted on their Facebook page that they couldn't connect calls. Of course I haven't even opened my own Facebook profile in years, how would I know, so I make calls unknowingly that Rebtel is not working. Mind you, voice system says everything it says on any other normal day, ""Welcome to Rebel please enter the international number you want to call'"" etc. So I call, I have topped up my account with about 500 minutes so I'm not even worried. I make my usual calls, to all my relatives, friends unknowingly. The next day I find out that instead of charging my Rebtel account as was supposed to happen all the calls (now I know it was due to their connectivity issues) of course AT&T picked them all up and now I had a $400 bill. After five days of trying to contact them, I wind up having to contact them through Facebook, and they end up saying oh we don't see any of your calls on our logs, well of course if your system was actually down you aren't going to see anything. Then they say we'll give you $20 credit as a sign of good faith. $400, $20 , good faith? Come on now.

"I downloaded Rebtel on my iPhone to call my boyfriend in Cuba. To be fair for the last three years I have been using google voice and Cuballama both of which have dropped calls, and sometimes it's almost impossible to hear eachother - as seems to be the case for most Cuban communications. I had high hopes having read the reviews on using Rebtel to call Cuba and getting crystal clear connections. So far: most of the time when I call it doesn't even ring on his end, and it eventually (1.5 min or more of ringing) it takes me to a message from Verizon (my carrier) saying the call couldn't be completed. Once in a while it connects perfectly and I can hear him very well - the best so far. He can not hear me as well, one time he got clear reception of my voice. My problem is the few times we have successfully connected, a few minutes into the conversation it drops the call and then I cannot get it to connect to him again no matter how many times I try to reconnect. It's so frustrating. I usually cannot get it to ring through to him again until the next day - and then again only once and only for about 10 minutes before it drops the call and won't reconnect. Like I said I had high hopes. ;(",Dropped calls to Cuba,3,12,3,2016,2,57,18,6,10,2016-03-12T02:57:18,United States,Jennifer Clasen,1,3,0,
"I have been using Rebtel for about two years now and to be honest, did this out of laziness on my part to find another provider but having spoken with a few friends now, done with Rebtel for following reasons:-",Not a Happy Customer!!,3,11,3,2016,13,59,7,5,10,2016-03-11T13:59:07,Canada,Jo Keyamo,1,2,0,
"My provider in Belgium (Telenet) have charged me for all the calls I have made via 2  deals to South AfricaI purchased via REBTEL.  Calls which should have cost me €23,80 have now been charged to me for the amount of €361,10. My provider have rejected my request for investigation that the calls were made via a REBTEL contact number as on the REBTEL  site. I have subsequently mailed Rebtel and am waiting for an answer.   I cannot believe this has happened and have requested they pay my provider (refund me) for the costs incurred.  Just getting my money back that I have paid via credit card to REBTEL is not an option as the purchase was made in good faith so that I could call cheaply to South Africa.   I hope there is a procedure for REBTEL  to take their full responsibility for this problem as they have reputable reviews which I checked at length before signing up for their service.  I advise that REBTEL remove deals from their website to avoid other people becoming victims of the same fate as it is for a reason we use REBTEL. NOT to be charged by our providers. January I used REBTEL via a contact number in Brussels to contact South Africa and my provider did not charge me.  February they charged me for every call made.  I sent 2 mails to REBTEL support last night with  proof of my bill from my provider clearly stating the number I called was the number given on the site as a the contact number for the country I was calling which was +27 87 550 23 47;  and will have to wait the 48 hours it will take to get an answer. I hope REBTEL contact my provider to sort this out as there is nowhere I can find a telephone number for customer service as everything has to be done by mail.  I hope and trust REBTEL will  solve this as it a very unpleasant experience. I have always had good response from Patricia at customer service.  In the meantime do not make any calls using a REBTEL contact number in your destination country.  Your provider will charge you full price.  Now is the time for me and for all of us  to really rate REBTEL on their customer service and solving this problem.   It is when things go wrong that the reviews really count.  I will keep everyone posted on progress in this matter.",My provieder in Belgium charged me for my calls to South Africa made via REBTEL,1,11,3,2016,8,28,15,5,10,2016-03-11T08:28:15,United States,Heidi De Jaeghere,1,1,0,

"Rebtel has some of the best prices to call to Cuba and I will stick with them.  The communication and sound are good.  However, it is very disappointing that they will round off your time to the following minute.   You spoke 5 minutes and 1 second, and this will count as 6 minutes used.  Long distance fees are high enough as they are, I wish they would count the real time spent on the phone.  If one calls oftens, a couple of minutes can be lost that way.  Otherwise it is good.",Round off minutes,3,25,2,2016,1,33,15,4,8,2016-02-25T01:33:15,United States,A-M,1,1,0,

I have been using Rebtel since 2010 when I first visited the USA.  I was in Boston Massachusetts for one year 2010 to 2011. Rebtel offered me a very convenient opportunity to communicate with family in Nigeria and elsewhere.  The practice of converting international numbers to local numbers made life really easy. Another point is the ability to recharge without breaking your discussion.  I have since recommended it for my wife.  In 2014 when my wife and I were in Texas we used Rebtel for the 5 months period of our stay.  Noe my wife is back to Massachusetts I made sure she continued with Rebtel.  i was pleasantly surprised that I can now use it in Congo and I have since registered and I am using it to call Nigeria.

"With the new app lost the ability to copy paste a whole number. The pre-set country dial code is irritating and requires too many clicks to change country destination calls whereas before I could just copy and paste a whole number including country code. Now with the preset country access if I paste it creates duplication of the first digits and requires more clicks to change to a different country. User interface was simpler to operate earlier I see no benefits in the new app. Customer service impossible to contact I had to go to discussion forum to find the email address and then took days to get a response that didn't answer my question, follow up was just ignored.

"I was a loyal Rebtel customer for the past few years (about 4 years) and Rebtel has been a better choice for me. I even wrote an excellent review in the past concerning quality and great customer service compared to other services. The price has been an issue from the beginning until the recent outrageous hike made me update my review. Calling Ethiopia went from average 19 cents(US) up to 27 cents per minute. That is a difference of 8 cents per minute!! I was using a deal that allowed me to talk for 50 minutes with approximately $10. Now, $10 allows you to talk only for 34 minutes and that is 27 cents per minute. I have been sticking around after their price changes in the past ( partly due to the ""deals"") and the problem I had with my mobile carrier third party application issue but this time, I am leaving for good! A price hike like this is not acceptable and I will be posting this on social media so that other Ethiopians stop using this service. I know many people who are doing that already, thanks to free internet calls and more internet coverage to Ethiopia. Why should we pay this much in 2016? Bye Rebtel! I am cancelling my account as we speak. I will start by taking away my credit card information from my profile and try other services for this week. It is unfair.",A new price hike to Ethiopia!

Your idea is great to get people on rebelsoth the new plan  but the only thing I find deceptive is that the recipient receives the call using data.

"As I was about to buy some credit from rebtel I saw a pop up message that said that I could try it 5 mins for free. Because I had a bad experience with similar companies in the past I thought it was a great idea so I clicked on the link which led me to their app that I had to download. I made the call using their app which clearly displayed the contact number and the time I had left. After many attempts( the person on the line couldn'thear me) I was told I had run out of credit that I should top up. Very annoyed by the whole thing I gave up and decided not to buy any credit from them. A few  days after that experience my phone company sent me an update of my usage since my last bill and I see that I had been charged for those mins of international calls I made using rebtel's app.  Alarmed I tried to contact rebtel but little did I know that they didn't even have a contact number or a customer service email address.

Been using this app for over six months . once you have an  account use on mobile or tablet platfom. Use with local calls to connect or via WiFi when on the move. When a technical issue the customer service always respond with a positive outcome. The ring tone is meaningless as does not indicate whether the receipient phone is busy offline ringing. etc. Quality of the calls is excellent. The best and cheapest app for phoning Cuba. Call counter timer only works with the WiFi mode so can be challenging knowing the exact duration of the call.

"I have been using Rebtel for a long time. Lately I have been having problems. I bought the Nigeria big saver plan. Even though I may have credit on the saver plan I cannot make calls.  When I try to make call, the message I get is that I have no more credit. The last time this happened I bought additional credit but Still, I could not make a call.  This is very frustrating. The customer service is horrible, the worst of any company I have ever dealt with.  First of all there is no customer service telephone number where you can speak to an actual person. The only option is to leave a message.  When you get a response, it is to tell you that they will respond within 48 hours.  I should therefore wait until 48 hours to make a telephone call that could very well be an emergency?. I WILL GIVE THEM ZERO STARS.  They do not even deserve one star. How can a telephone company not have a telephone number for their customers to call.  I will never recommend Rebtel to any one.

However one thing that I don't like is when you have 60 seconds left on the call, the 60s warning recording is way too long, that lady speak forever, and while she is speaking the caller can't hear anything, I think that could be changed to a short beep or something simpler, now the 60s warning recording is longer than a few months ago when it was already way to long.",Rebtel services review,5,6,2,2015,20,9,31,5,6,2015-02-06T20:09:31,United States,Dario,1,0,0,

"When I first used Rebtel (1 year ago) I found them to be excellent value and the call quality was great. However I recently went to Morocco & used their service.

"When my daughter moved to Australia from Canada I started to look into ways to make affordable international calls.

A friend of mine introduced me to rebtel few months ago and ever since I have stopped using phone cards to make international calls because rebtel is relatively cheaper and fast. You don't have to worry about the number for international call since rebtel connects you direct. It is also very reliable and connects you without fail.

Sure, rebtel rates are fairly cheap but is it really worth it when both of us cannot make out what the other person is saying?

We usually end our conversations more frustrated than anything because it's extremely annoying to have to repeat yourself over and over again. Also, there's a feature on the mobile app for collect SMS. Meaning the other person can text you and it will charge you. At least the SMS go through well, right? Well.. yes and no. I was ecstatic to find out that I can pay for her SMS sent to me because being in the Peace Corps, she's limited financially.

Now only €0,008 and only when the line is answered. Ghana and Mali have competetive prices. They can't still be cheap as €0,07 would be.

"I was excited by Rebtel when it was first recommended to me by a friend, and I've used it several times with success. However, in a recent experience, I called someone, they didn't answer, but then they called back using the Rebtel numbers, and unknowingly I somehow ""accepted"" a collect call. Because I believed the rate to be 1.5 cents per minute, I talked for 30 minutes, only to find my account charged for close to $9. Apparently a small noise made at the beginning of my call was supposed to alert me that I was getting charged at this absurdly high rate. I think it's abusive of Rebtel to believe anyone could figure that out. I promptly went into my settings and changed my alert for receiving collect calls - I suggest all other users do the same. But I am now much more hesitant to use Rebtel due to fear of other hidden charges.","Mainly great service, but some sneaky charges turned me off",3,6,2,2013,21,22,11,3,6,2013-02-06T21:22:11,United States,Jessica Hinojosa,1,0,0,

"Lately, the rate to call Japan was raised from 2 cents to 7 cents - 3 times higher. Yet, the quality became worse. On my recent call to Japan, I was able to hear my mother on the other end, but she did not hear me at all, so she hung up - 7 cents for this. Both of us could hear each other on the 2nd call. Then my phone lost battery, so the call was terminated, and I called again. Same as the 1st call - my mother did not hear me - another 7 cents for nothing. I called back and it worked okay for a while, but my balance was getting low, so I added funds ($10) during the call. Guess what? The call was ended by Rebtel when the balance dropped to $10.03.

"Hi there. I recently found out about rebtel and very quickly downloaded it  as an alternative to quite expansive italian rates for abroad calls. I needed sth cheap to stay in touch with my friends and family in Poland. However I found out the hard way that rebtel  fees and rates are not as clear as company want us to believe in. For example when you top up credit they charge extra tax to it. So for example a 20€ credit actually costs you 23€. But it's not all. According to the rebtel website a single minute to polish mobile phone should cost me 0,119€ but after a brief chat with my sister ( around 4 min) 1,5€ disappeared from my account. Connection itself isn't great either. So overall not sure if  Rebtel is such a great deal after all.",Be careful!,2,9,4,2012,21,52,56,1,15,2012-04-09T21:52:56,States,Agata Szreter,1,1,0,

In both cases, I was locked out due to a specific number they claimed I called.  I was told that number was in a block of numbers that they claim have been perpetrators of fraud on their service.  I have never called the number they claimed I called.  Hopefully their automatic fraud detection system will improve, as it is obviously quite buggy.
